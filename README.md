# Exploratory data analysis with a diamond dataset

---

It's been a long time since I did some EDA with R. Now I am re descovering the language with the use of the package Tidyverse, which is not far from addictive. It makes easier the manipulation and cleaning of information and I want to take a look at it in depth doing some exploratory data analysis.

There are a lot of built-in datasets with R itself, after doing a little bit of exploration with the data() method, I found the diamon dataset that has different data parameters. Let's do some exploration data analysis and cleaning if necessary.

## Questions

> The first part in every EDA is to make sure which questions do we want to answer. The questions need to be as clear and as precise as possible in order to avoid getting of the analysis path.

*  Distribution of prices 
*  Average volume
*  Volum diference between cuts
*  Is there some cut more expensive than others?
*  Which is the most common type of diamond?
*  Which is the average price of all types of cuts?
*  Which is the average price of all the different types of diamonds?
